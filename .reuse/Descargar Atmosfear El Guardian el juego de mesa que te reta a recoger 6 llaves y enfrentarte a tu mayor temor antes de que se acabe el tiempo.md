Atmosfear: The Guardian is a game that can be played by 3 to 6 players, aged 12 and up. The game duration is about 45 minutes, depending on the skill and luck of the players. The game components include a game board, a DVD, 37 cards, 6 playing pieces, 36 keys, a well of fears, and a die. The game board has six zones, each with a different color and theme. The zones are the black hole, the poltergeist, the vampire's tower, the zombie's graveyard, the mummy's tomb, and the werewolf's forest.
 
The objective of the game is to collect one key from each zone and return to the well of fears in the center of the board. The first player to do so wins the game. However, the game is not as simple as it sounds. The DVD features The Guardian, a hooded figure who controls the game and interacts with the players. The Guardian will randomly announce different events and effects that will affect the gameplay. For example, he might change the time limit, swap the keys, send players to different zones, or challenge them to a duel. The Guardian will also ask players trivia questions or dare them to perform tasks. If they fail, they might lose a key or be sent to the black hole.
 
The game is designed to create a tense and immersive atmosphere for the players. The DVD has different sound effects and music that match the theme of each zone. The Guardian will also try to scare and distract the players with his creepy voice and appearance. The game can be customized by choosing different difficulty levels and game modes on the DVD menu. For example, there is a mode where The Guardian will not ask any questions or dare any tasks, but will only announce events and effects. There is also a mode where The Guardian will only interact with one player at a time.
