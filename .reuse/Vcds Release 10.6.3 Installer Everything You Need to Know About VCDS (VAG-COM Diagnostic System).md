While VCDS is a powerful and useful tool, it also comes with some risks that you should be aware of before using it. Some of the possible risks are:

- Damage to your car's electronics or software. If you use VCDS to change settings or codes that are not compatible with your car's model or configuration, you may cause errors, malfunctions, or even permanent damage to your car's systems. You should always backup your original settings before making any changes and consult a professional if you are not sure what you are doing.
- Voiding your car's warranty. Some car manufacturers may consider using VCDS as a modification that voids your car's warranty. This means that if you encounter any problems with your car that are related to the use of VCDS, you may not be covered by the warranty and have to pay for the repairs yourself. You should check with your car dealer or manufacturer before using VCDS if you are concerned about this issue.
- Injury or death. If you use VCDS to disable or alter safety features such as airbags, seatbelts, brakes, or steering, you may put yourself and others at risk of injury or death in case of an accident. You should never use VCDS to compromise your car's safety or performance.

VCDS is a tool that should be used with caution and responsibility. You should always follow the instructions and recommendations from Ross-Tech and other reputable sources when using VCDS. You should also test your car's functions and systems after using VCDS to make sure everything is working properly.[^1^]
