A TS3 spam bot is a program that connects to your TeamSpeak server as a client and performs some actions automatically, such as sending messages to chat channels, poking users, or playing sounds. You can use a TS3 spam bot to annoy your friends, test your server's security, or just have some fun. However, you should be careful not to abuse your TS3 spam bot or violate the rules of your server, as this may result in a ban or other consequences.
 
To create a TS3 spam bot, you will need the following tools:
 
- A TeamSpeak client installed on your computer.
- A TeamSpeak server that you have access to.
- A TS3 query account that allows you to connect to your server using the Telnet protocol.
- A TS3 query script that contains the commands and parameters for your TS3 spam bot.
- A Telnet client that allows you to run your TS3 query script.

1. Create a TS3 query account on your TeamSpeak server. You can do this by logging in as an administrator and going to Tools > ServerQuery Login. Enter a username and password for your TS3 query account and click OK. You will also see the port number for your TS3 query connection.
2. Create a TS3 query script that contains the commands and parameters for your TS3 spam bot. You can use any text editor to write your script, or you can use one of the existing scripts that are available online. For example, you can use [this GitHub topic](https://github.com/topics/teamspeak3-bot) [^1^] to find some scripts that are written in different programming languages, such as PHP, JavaScript, or Python. You can also use [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMrHVPC5PI8) [^2^] to learn how to write a simple script that can poke users on your server.
3. Run your TS3 query script using a Telnet client. You can use any Telnet client that supports running scripts, such as PuTTY or Netcat. To connect to your TeamSpeak server using Telnet, you will need the IP address or hostname of your server, the port number of your TS3 query connection, and the username and password of your TS3 query account. Once you are connected, you can run your script by typing its name or path and pressing Enter. Your TS3 spam bot will start performing the actions that are defined in your script.

Congratulations! You have created a TS3 spam bot for your TeamSpeak server. You can now enjoy the results of your prank or experiment. However, remember to be respectful and responsible with your TS3 spam bot and do not cause any harm or trouble to other users or servers.
