## How to Use Ghost Town?
 
Ghost Town is very easy to use, but there are some things you need to know before you start building your city. Here are some steps to follow:
 
1. Open 3ds Max and create a new scene. Make sure your system units are set to metric/cm.
2. Go to Customize > Customize User Interface > Toolbars and find Ghost Town under the category Kilad. Drag it to your toolbar and click on it to open the plugin window.
3. In the plugin window, you will see four tabs: Setup, Materials, ObjLibrary and RoadTool. We will start with the Setup tab.
4. In the Setup tab, you can choose the type of city you want to create: Low Poly or High Poly. Low Poly cities are faster to generate and render, but less detailed. High Poly cities are more realistic and detailed, but slower to generate and render. You can also choose the size of your city by adjusting the City Size slider.
5. Next, you need to draw a shape on the grid that defines the boundary of your city. You can use any shape tool from 3ds Max, such as Line or Rectangle. Make sure your shape is closed and does not cross itself. Also make sure your shape is drawn between the blue and red lines on the grid, otherwise the plugin will not work properly.
6. Select your shape and click on Build in the plugin window. The plugin will ask you if you want to set the system units to metric/cm. Click Yes. The plugin will then start building your city based on your shape and settings.
7. After the plugin finishes building your city, you can see it in the viewport. You can also edit your city by selecting it and clicking on Edit in the plugin window. This will open a new window where you can adjust various parameters of your city, such as building height, density, variation, rotation and more.
8. If you want to add more details to your city, such as roads, vehicles, trees and facades, you can use the other tabs in the plugin window. The Materials tab allows you to assign different materials and textures to your buildings. The ObjLibrary tab allows you to add custom objects from a library of presets or your own models. The RoadTool tab allows you to create spline-based roads that follow your terrain and add bridges and lots.

## Conclusion
 
Ghost Town is a powerful and easy-to-use plugin that can help you create stunning cities in 3ds Max. Whether you need a low poly city for a game or a high poly city for a film or animation, Ghost Town can save you time and effort by generating urban environments with just a few clicks. You can also customize your city with different materials, textures, objects and roads to suit your needs and preferences.
